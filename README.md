Car Sales Data Analysis Project ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

A mini data analysis project using Python to explore car sales performance across various metrics. This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

ðŸ“Œ Overview
We explore data on 10 different car models and analyze:
Units sold
Average selling price
Customer satisfaction
Profit margin
Yearly growth

ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated

Cleaning missing data using pandas
Filtering and sorting for insights
Creating charts: bar, line, pie, histogram, scatter using matplotlib
Summarizing data with descriptive stats and visual cues

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

Bar Chart: Units sold by car model
Line Plot: Average price trend
Pie Chart: Market share by units sold
Histogram: Customer satisfaction distribution
Scatter Plot: Profit margin vs. yearly growth

ðŸ§¹ Handling Missing Data

Some fields had missing values which were filled with the column's mean to avoid losing any model from analysis.

âœ… What I Learned

How to handle real-world-like missing data
Building business insights from visual data
Working with pandas and matplotlib for storytelling with data
